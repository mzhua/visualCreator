##About

**Visual Creator** is based on open web tool developed at the [DensityDesign Research Lab](http://www.densitydesign.org) (Politecnico di Milano) to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) library by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/).
Primarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, RAW aims at providing a missing link  between spreadsheet applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Docs, OpenRefine, …) and vector graphics editors (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, …).
